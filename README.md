# Pyinvoke Automation Scripts

This repository holds a set of automation scripts for
some tasks like binary distribution downloading, shell setup, 
docker image handling, local kubernetes
development, etc.

## Setup

This repo should be *sub-moduled* at the top of the repo and the 
`invoke` command should be available system-wide, although installing
it in the repo where sub-moduled should be fine.
